            <b>Dr.Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi</b>Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi (31 March 1865 â€“ 26 February 1887) was the first Indian female doctor of western medicine. 
            She was the first woman from the erstwhile Bombay presidency of India to study and graduate with a two-year degree in western medicine in the United States.
            She was also referred to as Anandibai Joshi and Anandi Gopal Joshi

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Originally named Yamuna, Joshi was born, raised in a Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin family As was the practice at that time and due to pressure from her mother, she was married at the age of nine to Gopalrao Joshi, a widower almost twenty years her senior.
            After marriage, Yamuna's husband renamed her 'Anandi'.
            Gopalrao Joshi worked as a postal clerk in Kalyan. Later, he was transferred to Alibag, and then, finally, to Kolhapoor (Kolhapur). He was a progressive thinker, and, unusually for that time, supported education for women. She was also a relative of Pandita Ramabai.
            At the age of fourteen, Anandibai gave birth to a boy, but the child lived only for a total of ten days due to lack of medical care. This proved to be a turning point in Anandi's life and inspired her to become a physician.
            After Gopalrao tried to enroll her in missionary schools and not working out, they moved to Calcutta. 
            There she learned to read and speak Sanskrit and English.
           In the 1800s, it was very unusual for husbands to focus on their wives' education. 
           Gopalrao was obsessed with the idea of Anandibai's education and wanted her to learn medicine and create her own identity in the world. One day, he came into the kitchen and found her cooking with her grandmother and proceeded to go into a raging fit.
          It was very uncommon for husbands to beat their wives for cooking instead of reading. As Gopalrao's obsession with Joshi's education grew, he sent her with Mrs Carpenter, a Philadelphian missionary, to America to study medicine. 
          Before her voyage, she addressed a public hall in 1883. She addressed the lack of women doctors and said "I volunteer myself as one."[11] She also mentioned how midwifery was not sufficient in any case and that instructors who teach these classes have conservative views. 
          Gopalrao eventually moved to America when he felt displeased by her efforts.
          By the time he arrived in Philadelphia, she had completed her studies and was a doctor.

          <h3>Academic Life</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Her husband encouraged her to study medicine. 
            In 1880 he sent a letter to Royal Wilder, a well-known American missionary, stating his wife's interest in inquiring about a suitable post in the US for herself.</li>
            <li>Wilder published the correspondence in his Princeton's Missionary Review. Theodicia Carpenter, a resident of Roselle, New Jersey, happened to read it while waiting to see her dentist.
            Impressed by both Anandibai's desire to study medicine, and Gopalrao's support for his wife, she wrote to Anandibai.</li>
            <li>While the Joshi couple was in Calcutta, Anandibai's health was declining.
            She suffered from weakness, constant headaches, occasional fever, and sometimes breathlessness. </li>
            <li> Theodicia sent her medicines from America, without results. In 1883, Gopalrao was transferred to Serampore, and he decided to send Anandibai by herself to America for her medical studies despite her poor health.
            Though apprehensive, Gopalrao convinced her to set an example for other women by pursuing higher education.</li>  
            <li>A physician couple named Thorborn suggested that Anandibai apply to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania.
            On learning of Anandibai's plans to pursue higher education in the West, orthodox Indian society censured her very strongly.</li>  
            <li>Anandibai addressed the community at Serampore College Hall, explaining her decision to go to America and obtain a medical degree.</li>  
            <li>She discussed the persecution she and her husband had endured.</li>  
            <li>She stressed the need for female doctors in India, emphasizing that Hindu women could better serve as physicians to Hindu women</li>
            <li> Her speech received publicity, and financial contributions started pouring in from all over India.</li>
